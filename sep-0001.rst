What is a SEP?
==============

SEP stands for Space Decentral Enhancement Proposal.  A SEP is a design
document providing information to the Space Decentral community, or describing
a new feature for the Space Decentral platform or its governance processes.
The SEP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature.

We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the
design decisions that have gone into Space Decentral.  The SEP author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions.

Because the SEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.


SEP Types
=========

There are three kinds of SEPs:

1. A **Standards Track** SEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for Space Decentral. It may also describe an API that will
   be supported outside the `Space Decentral GitHub`_.

2. An **Informational** SEP describes a Space Decentral design issue, or
   provides general guidelines or information to the Space Decentral community,
   but does not propose a new feature.  Informational SEPs do not
   necessarily represent a Space Decentral community consensus or
   recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
   Informational SEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** SEP describes a process surrounding Space Decentral, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process SEPs are
   like Standards Track SEPs but apply to areas other than the Space Decentral
   platform itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   Space Decentral's codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike
   Informational SEPs, they are more than recommendations, and users
   are typically not free to ignore them.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in Space Decentral development.
   Any meta-SEP is also considered a Process SEP.


SEP Workflow
============


SEP Editors
-----------

The SEP editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative
and editorial aspects of the SEP workflow (e.g. assigning SEP numbers and
changing their status).  See `SEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow`_ for
details.  The current editors are:

* <vacant>

SEP editorship is by invitation of the current editors, and they can be
contacted via the address <info@spacedecentral.net>, but you may only need to use this
to contact the editors semi-privately.  All of the SEP workflow can be
conducted via the GitHub `SEP repository`_ issues and pull requests.


Start with an idea for Space Decentral
--------------------------------------

The SEP process begins with a new idea for Space Decentral.  It is highly
recommended that a single SEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need
a SEP and can be injected into the Space Decentral development workflow with a
patch submission to the Space Decentral `Space Decentral Network - Issues`_. The more focused the
SEP, the more successful it tends to be.  The SEP editors reserve the
right to reject SEP proposals if they appear too unfocused or too
broad.  If in doubt, split your SEP into several well-focused ones.

Each SEP must have a champion -- someone who writes the SEP using the style
and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.  The SEP
champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is
SEP-able.  Posting to the `SD Goverance riot room` is the best way to go about this.

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a SEP is meant
to save the potential author time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing Space Decentral that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the Space Decentral community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching
the internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure
the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author.
Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not
mean it will work for most people in most areas where Space Decentral is used.

Once the champion has asked the Space Decentral community as to whether an
idea has any chance of acceptance, a draft SEP should be presented to
Space Decentral-ideas.  This gives the author a chance to flesh out the draft
SEP to make properly formatted, of high quality, and to address
initial concerns about the proposal.


Submitting a SEP
----------------

Following a discussion on Space Decentral-ideas, the proposal should be submitted as a
draft SEP via a `GitHub pull request`_.  The draft must be written in SEP
style as described below, else it will fail review immediately (although minor
errors may be corrected by the editors).

The standard SEP workflow is:

* You, the SEP author, fork the `SEP repository`_, and create a file named
  ``sep-9999.rst`` that contains your new SEP.  Use "9999" as your draft SEP
  number.

* In the "Type:" header field, enter "Standards Track",
  "Informational", or "Process" as appropriate, and for the "Status:"
  field enter "Draft".  For full details, see `SEP Header Preamble`_.

* Push this to your GitHub fork and submit a pull request.

* The SEP editors review your PR for structure, formatting, and other
  errors.  For a reST-formatted SEP, PEP 12 is provided as a template.
  It also provides a complete introduction to reST markup that is used
  in SEPs.  Approval criteria are:

  * It sound and complete.  The ideas must make technical sense.  The
    editors do not consider whether they seem likely to be accepted.
  * The title accurately describes the content.
  * The SEP's language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.) 
    and code style (examples should match PEP 8 & PEP 7) should be
    correct and conformant.  The SEP will be checked for formatting
    (plain text or reStructuredText) by Travis CI, and will not be
    approved until this passes.

  Editors are generally quite lenient about this initial review,
  expecting that problems will be corrected by the reviewing process.
  **Note:** Approval of the SEP is no guarantee that there are no
  embarrassing mistakes!  Correctness is the responsibility of authors
  and reviewers, not the editors.

  If the SEP isn't ready for approval, an editor will send it back to
  the author for revision, with specific instructions.

* Once approved, they will assign your SEP a number.

Once the review process is complete, and the SEP editors approve it (note that
this is *not* the same as accepting your SEP!), they will squash commit your
pull request onto master.

The SEP editors will not unreasonably deny a SEP.  Reasons for denying SEP
status include duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing
proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping
with the Space Decentral philosophy.

Developers with git push privileges for the `SEP repository`_ may claim SEP
numbers directly by creating and committing a new SEP. When doing so, the
developer must handle the tasks that would normally be taken care of by the
SEP editors (see `SEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow`_). This includes
ensuring the initial version meets the expected standards for submitting a
SEP. Alternately, even developers may choose to submit SEPs via pull request.
When doing so, let the SEP editors know you have git push privileges and they
can guide you through the process of updating the SEP repository directly.

As updates are necessary, the SEP author can check in new versions if they
(or a collaborating developer) have git push privileges.

After a SEP number has been assigned, a draft SEP may be discussed further on
Space Decentral-ideas (getting a SEP number assigned early can be useful for ease of
reference, especially when multiple draft SEPs are being considered at the
same time).

Standards Track SEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  It is generally recommended that at least a
prototype implementation be co-developed with the SEP, as ideas that sound
good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the
test of implementation.

SEP authors are responsible for collecting community feedback on a SEP
before submitting it for review. However, wherever possible, long
open-ended discussions on public mailing lists should be avoided.
Strategies to keep the discussions efficient include: setting up a
separate SIG mailing list for the topic, having the SEP author accept
private comments in the early design phases, setting up a wiki page, etc.
SEP authors should use their discretion here.


SEP Review & Resolution
-----------------------

Once the authors have completed a SEP, they may request a review for
style and consistency from the SEP editors.

For a SEP to be accepted it must meet certain minimum criteria.  It
must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement.
The enhancement must represent a net improvement.  The proposed
implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate
the interpreter unduly.  Finally, a proposed enhancement must be
"Space Decentralic" in order to be accepted.  (However, "Space Decentralic"
is an imprecise term; it may be defined as whatever is acceptable to
the SEP editors.  This logic is intentionally circular.)

Once a SEP has been accepted, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated
into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to "Final".

To allow gathering of additional design and interface feedback before committing
to long term stability for a feature or API, a SEP may also be marked as
"Provisional". This is short for "Provisionally Accepted", and indicates that
the proposal has been accepted for inclusion in the reference implementation,
but additional user feedback is needed before the full design can be considered
"Final". Unlike regular accepted SEPs, provisionally accepted SEPs may still be
Rejected or Withdrawn *even after the related changes have been included in a
Space Decentral release*.

Wherever possible, it is considered preferable to reduce the scope of a proposal
to avoid the need to rely on the "Provisional" status (e.g. by deferring some
features to later SEPs), as this status can lead to version compatibility
challenges in the wider Space Decentral ecosystem. SEP 411 provides additional
details on potential use cases for the Provisional status.

A SEP can also be assigned the status "Deferred".  The SEP author or an
editor can assign the SEP this SEP when no progress is being made
on the SEP.  Once a SEP is deferred, a SEP editor can re-assign it
to draft SEP.

A SEP can also be "Rejected".  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact. The "Withdrawn" SEP is similar - it means that the SEP author
themselves has decided that the SEP is actually a bad idea, or has
accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When a SEP is Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn, the SEP should be updated
accordingly.

SEPs can also be superseded by a different SEP, rendering the original
obsolete.  This is intended for Informational SEPs, where version 2 of
an API can replace version 1.

The possible paths of the SEP of SEPs are as follows:

.. image:: sep-0001-process_flow.png
   :alt: SEP process flow diagram

While not shown in the diagram, "Accepted" SEPs may technically move to
"Rejected" or "Withdrawn" even after acceptance. This will only occur if
the implementation process reveals fundamental flaws in the design that were
not noticed prior to acceptance of the SEP. Unlike Provisional SEPs, these
transitions are only permitted if the accepted proposal has *not* been included
in a Space Decentral release - released changes must instead go through the regular
deprecation process (which may require a new SEP providing the rationale for
the deprecation).

Some Informational and Process SEPs may also have a SEP of "Active"
if they are never meant to be completed.  E.g. SEP 1 (this SEP).


SEP Maintenance
---------------

In general, Standards track SEPs are no longer modified after they have
reached the Final state. Once a SEP has been completed, the references become
the formal documentation of the expected behavior.

If changes based on implementation experience and user feedback are made to
Standards track SEPs while in the Accepted or Provisional State, those changes
should be noted in the SEP, such that the SEP accurately describes the state of
the implementation at the point where it is marked Final.

Informational and Process SEPs may be updated over time to reflect changes
to development practices and other details. The precise process followed in
these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the SEP being updated.



What belongs in a successful SEP?
=================================

Each SEP should have the following parts:

1. Preamble -- RFC 822 style headers containing meta-data about the
   SEP, including the SEP number, a short descriptive title (limited
   to a maximum of 44 characters), the names, and optionally the
   contact info for each author, etc.

2. Abstract -- a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue
   being addressed.

3. Copyright/public domain -- Each SEP must either be explicitly labeled as
   placed in the public domain under the terms of the CC0 1.0 license (see 
   this SEP as an example) or licensed under the `Open Publication License`_.

4. Specification -- The technical specification should describe the
   syntax and semantics of any new platform feature.  The
   specification should be detailed enough to allow competing,
   interoperable implementations for at least the current major Space Decentral
   platforms (CSpace Decentral, Jython, IronSpace Decentral, PyPy).

5. Motivation -- The motivation is critical for SEPs that want to
   change the Space Decentral platform.  It should clearly explain why the
   existing specification is inadequate to address the
   problem that the SEP solves.  SEP submissions without sufficient
   motivation may be rejected outright.

6. Rationale -- The rationale fleshes out the specification by
   describing what motivated the design and why particular design
   decisions were made.  It should describe alternate designs that
   were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported
   in other platforms.

   The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the
   community and discuss important objections or concerns raised
   during discussion.

7. Backwards Compatibility -- All SEPs that introduce backwards
   incompatibilities must include a section describing these
   incompatibilities and their severity.  The SEP must explain how the
   author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.  SEP
   submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise
   may be rejected outright.

8. Reference Implementation -- The reference implementation must be
   completed before any SEP is given status "Final", but it need not
   be completed before the SEP is accepted.  While there is merit
   to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and
   rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus
   and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many
   discussions of API details.

   The final implementation must include test code and documentation
   appropriate for the Space Decentral reference.

9. How to Teach This -- For a SEP that adds new functionality or changes
   platform behavior, it is helpful to include a section on how to
   teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the SEP to their
   work.

   This section may include key points and recommended documentation
   changes that would help users adopt a new feature or migrate their
   code to use a platform change.


SEP Formats and Templates
=========================

SEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the reStructuredText_ format.
ReStructuredText_ allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to
read, but also results in good-looking and functional HTML.


SEP Header Preamble
===================

Each SEP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble.  The headers
must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with "*" are
optional and are described below.  All other headers are required. ::

    SEP: <sep number>
    Title: <sep title>
    Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addrs>
  * BDFL-Delegate: <SEP czar's real name>
  * Discussions-To: <email address>
    Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Provisional | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    Type: <Standards Track | Informational | Process>
  * Content-Type: <text/x-rst | text/plain>
  * Requires: <sep numbers>
    Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * Space Decentral-Version: <version number>
    Post-History: <dates of postings to Space Decentral-ideas and/or Space Decentral-dev>
  * Replaces: <sep number>
  * Superseded-By: <sep number>
  * Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors/owners of the SEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  For historical reasons the format
"address@dom.ain (Random J. User)" may appear in a SEP, however new
SEPs must use the mandated format above, and it is acceptable to
change to this format when SEPs are updated.

If there are multiple authors, each should be on a separate line
following RFC 2822 continuation line conventions.  Note that personal
email addresses in SEPs will be obscured as a defense against spam
harvesters.

The BDFL-Delegate field is used to record cases where the final decision to
approve or reject a SEP rests with someone other than the BDFL. (The
delegate's email address is currently omitted due to a limitation in the
email address masking for reStructuredText SEPs)

*Note: The Resolution header is required for Standards Track SEPs
only.  It contains a URL that should point to an email message or
other web resource where the pronouncement about the SEP is made.*

For a SEP where final pronouncement will be made on a list other than
Space Decentral-dev, a Discussions-To header will indicate the mailing list
or URL where the pronouncement will occur. A temporary Discussions-To header
may also be used when a draft SEP is being discussed prior to submission for
pronouncement. No Discussions-To header is necessary if the SEP is being
discussed privately with the author, or on the Space Decentral-list, Space Decentral-ideas
or Space Decentral-dev mailing lists.  Note that email addresses in the
Discussions-To header will not be obscured.

The Type header specifies the type of SEP: Standards Track,
Informational, or Process.

The format of a SEP is specified with a Content-Type header.  The
acceptable values are "text/x-rst" for reStructuredText SEPs (see PEP 12 [2]_).
reStructuredText is strongly preferred, but for backwards
compatibility plain text is currently still the default if no
Content-Type header is present.

The Created header records the date that the SEP was assigned a
number, while Post-History is used to record the dates of when new
versions of the SEP are posted to Space Decentral-ideas and/or Space Decentral-dev.  Both
headers should be in dd-mmm-yyyy format, e.g. 14-Aug-2001.

Standards Track SEPs will typically have a Space Decentral-Version header which
indicates the version of Space Decentral that the feature will be released with.
Standards Track SEPs without a Space Decentral-Version header indicate
interoperability standards that will initially be supported through
external libraries and tools, and then potentially supplemented by a later SEP
to add support to the platform. Informational and Process SEPs do
not need a Space Decentral-Version header.

SEPs may have a Requires header, indicating the SEP numbers that this
SEP depends on.

SEPs may also have a Superseded-By header indicating that a SEP has
been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of
the SEP that replaces the current document.  The newer SEP must have a
Replaces header containing the number of the SEP that it rendered
obsolete.


Auxiliary Files
===============

SEPs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams.  Such files should be
named ``sep-XXXX-Y.ext``, where "XXXX" is the SEP number, "Y" is a
serial number (starting at 1), and "ext" is replaced by the actual
file extension (e.g. "png").

Alternatively, all support files may be placed in a subdirectory called
``sep-XXXX``, where "XXXX" is the SEP number. When using a subdirectory, there
are no constraints on the names used in files.


Reporting SEP Bugs, or Submitting SEP Updates
=============================================

How you report a bug, or submit a SEP update depends on several
factors, such as the maturity of the SEP, the preferences of the SEP
author, and the nature of your comments.  For the early draft stages
of the SEP, it's probably best to send your comments and changes
directly to the SEP author.  For more mature, or finished SEPs you may
want to submit corrections as a `GitHub issue`_ or `GitHub pull request`_ so that
your changes don't get lost.

When in doubt about where to send your changes, please check first
with the SEP author and/or a SEP editor.

SEP authors with git push privileges for the SEP repository can update the
SEPs themselves by using "git push" or the GitHub PR interface to submit their
changes.


Transferring SEP Ownership
==========================

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of SEPs to a
new champion.  In general, it is preferable to retain the original author as
a co-author of the transferred SEP, but that's really up to the
original author.  A good reason to transfer ownership is because the
original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the SEP process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email).  A bad
reason to transfer ownership is because the author doesn't agree with the
direction of the SEP.  One aim of the SEP process is to try to build
consensus around a SEP, but if that's not possible, an author can always
submit a competing SEP.

If you are interested in assuming ownership of a SEP, you can also do this via
pull request.  Fork the `SEP repository`_, make your ownership modification,
and submit a pull request.  You should also send a message asking to take
over, addressed to both the original author and the SEP editors.  If the
original author doesn't respond to email in a timely manner, the SEP editors
will make a unilateral decision - it's not like such decisions can't be reversed
:).


SEP Editor Responsibilities & Workflow
======================================

A SEP editor must watch the `SEP repository`_.  Most correspondence regarding
SEP administration can be handled through GitHub issues and pull requests, but
you may also use the `SD Goverance riot room` for SEP related discussions.

For each new SEP that comes in, an editor does the following:

* Read the SEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete.  The ideas
  must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
  accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Skim the SEP for obvious defects in language (spelling, grammar,
  sentence structure, etc.), and code style (WIP). Editors may correct problems
  themselves, but are not required to do so.  
  (WIP: Text format is checked by Travis CI.)

If the SEP isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the author for
revision, with specific instructions.  If reST formatting is a
problem, ask the author(s) to use PEP 12 as a template and resubmit.

Once the SEP is ready for the repository, a SEP editor will:

* Assign a SEP number (almost always just the next available number,
  but sometimes it's a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).
  (Clarification: For Space Decentral 3, numbers in the 3000s were used for
  Py3k-specific proposals.  But now that all new features go into
  Space Decentral 3 only, the process is back to using numbers in the 100s again.
  Remember that numbers below 100 are meta-SEPs.)

* Check that the author has correctly labeled the SEP's type
  ("Standards Track", "Informational", or "Process"), and marked its
  status as "Draft".

* Add the SEP to a local fork of the `SEP repository`_.  For workflow
  instructions, follow `The Space Decentral Developers Guide <http://docs.spacedecentral.net/devguide>`_

  The git repo for the seps is::

   https://github.com/spacedecentral/seps

* Commit and push the new (or updated) SEP

* Monitor spacedecentral.net to make sure the SEP gets added to the site
  properly. If it fails to appear, running ``make`` will build all of the
  current SEPs. If any of these are triggering errors, they must be
  corrected before any SEP will update on the site.


Updates to existing SEPs should be submitted as a `GitHub pull request`_.
Questions may of course still be sent to <info@spacedecentral.net>.

Many SEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access
to the Space Decentral codebase.  The SEP editors monitor the Space Decentral-checkins
list for SEP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or
markup mistakes they see.

SEP editors don't pass judgment on SEPs.  They merely do the
administrative & editorial part (which is generally a low volume task).
